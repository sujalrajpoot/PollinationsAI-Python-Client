## Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```python
from pollinations_ai import PollinationsAI, ModelType

# Initialize client
client = PollinationsAI()

# Chat example
try:
    response = client.chat("What is artificial intelligence?")
    print(f"Response: {response}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Generate image
try:
    result = client.generate_image(
        prompt="A serene lake at sunset with mountains in the background",
        model=ModelType.FLUX_3D,
        image_path="sunset_lake.png"
    )
    print(result)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

### Available Models
The client supports multiple AI models for image generation:
- Flux
- Flux Realism
- Any Dark
- Flux Anime
- Flux 3D
- Turbo

## Detailed Documentation

### PollinationsAI Class
The main client class that provides access to both chat and image generation services.

```python
class PollinationsAI:
    def __init__(self, timeout: int = 10):
        """Initialize with custom timeout if needed"""
        
    def chat(self, prompt: str, system_prompt: str = "You are a helpful assistant.") -> str:
        """Send a chat request"""
        
    def generate_image(
        self,
        prompt: str,
        model: ModelType = ModelType.FLUX_3D,
        image_path: str = "image.png",
        width: int = 1024,
        height: int = 1024,
        enhance: bool = True
    ) -> str:
        """Generate an image with specified parameters"""
```

### Error Handling
The client includes a comprehensive error handling system:
```python
try:
    response = client.chat("Hello")
except PollinationsError as e:
    print(f"API Error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

## Best Practices

### Image Generation
1. Use descriptive prompts for better results
2. Consider image dimensions for your use case
3. Enable enhancement for better quality
4. Use appropriate model for your desired style

### Chat Integration
1. Provide clear, concise prompts
2. Use system prompts to guide AI behavior
3. Handle responses appropriately
4. Implement proper error handling
